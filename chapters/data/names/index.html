      <h1>Baby Names Data Set</h1>

      <p>The following data comes from
      a <a href="https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/limits.html">data
	  set of baby names</a>. The information below is copied from
	the ReadMe file for this data set.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="blockquote">
	<p>
	For each year of birth YYYY after 1879, we created a
	comma-delimited file called yobYYYY.txt.
	Each record in the individual annual files has the format
	"name,sex,number," where name is 2 to 15 characters, sex is M
	(male) or F (female) and "number" is the number of occurrences
	of the name. Each file is sorted first on sex and then on
	number of occurrences in descending order. When there is a tie
	on the number of occurrences, names are listed in alphabetical
	order. This sorting makes it easy to determine a name's
	rank. The first record for each sex has rank 1, the second
	record for each sex has rank 2, and so forth.
	</p>
	
	<p>To safeguard privacy, we restrict our list of names to those with at least 5 occurrences.</p>

      <p>For example, the names of babies born in 2000 can be found in
	the file <a href="https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/names/yob2000.txt">https://dlsun.github.io/pods/data/names/yob2000.txt</a>.
