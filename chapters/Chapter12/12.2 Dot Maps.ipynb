        "A **dot map** is a way to visualize the locations of events in space. In a dot map, points are added to a map to represent the geographic location of some event.\n",

        "The most important dot map ever made is perhaps John Snow's map of the cholera cases during the 1854 London cholera outbreak. At the time, the cause of cholera was unknown. Snow's dot map showed that the cholera cases centered around a particular water pump, the Broad Street pump. (In the days before running water, residents had to fetch water from the local water pump.) Snow's dot map is shown below; each \"dot\" in this map is a thin black box. Snow stacked the boxes when there were multiple people in one residence that contracted cholera. At this resolution, the data appear as black bars of different heights, but if you zoom in, you will see the individual \"dots\".\n",

        "\n",
        "> There were only ten deaths in houses situated decidedly nearer to another street-pump. In five of these cases the families of the deceased persons informed me that they always sent to the pump in Broad Street, as they preferred the water to that of the pumps which were nearer. In three other cases, the deceased were children who went to school near the pump in Broad Street....\n",
        "\n",
        "In the end, Snow was able to build a strong case that the Broad Street pump was the source of the cholera outbreak.\n",
        "\n",
        "> The result of the inquiry, then, is, that there was been no particular outbreak or prevalence of cholera in this part of London except among the persons who were in the habit of drinking the water of the above-mentioned pump well. I had an interview with the Board of Guardians of St James's parish, on the evening of [September 7], and represented the above circumstances to them. In consequence of what I said, the handle of the pump was removed on the following day."
