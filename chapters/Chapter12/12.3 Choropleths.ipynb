The \"states\" that had more than one county missing election data are all outlying territories: Puerto Rico (72), Northern Mariana Islands (69), Virgin Islands (78), American Samoa (60), and Guam (66). It turns out that the two remaining states, each with exactly one county that could not be joined, are Alaska (02) and Hawaii (15), which do not show up on our map of the continental United States. So we can safely fill the missing values in `df_all` with an arbitrary value in the middle of the data range without affecting the appearance of the map, since none of these states/territories actually show up on the map."

In fact, most of the red area is in rural parts of the country where few people live. From the choropleth, one would never guess that more people actually voted for his opponent Hillary Clinton!
