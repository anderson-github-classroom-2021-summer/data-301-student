In the summer months, plants absorb $\\text{CO}_2$ from the atmosphere as part of photosynthesis, in order to grow flowers and leaves. In the winter months, these leaves fall to the ground, where they are broken down by microbes that emit $\\text{CO}_2$ in the process. \n",

Although this can be done manually, `pandas` provides a convenience method, `.resample()`, that changes the sampling frequency of the time series. The `.resample()` function works like `.groupby()`; you have to specify a column and an aggregation function. In the code below, we average the **ppm** in each year to obtain a time series with a sampling frequency of 1 cycle per year."
