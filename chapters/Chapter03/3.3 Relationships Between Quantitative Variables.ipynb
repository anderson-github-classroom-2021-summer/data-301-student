    "$$ \\text{Cov}[X, Y] = \\frac{1}{n - 1} \\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i - \\bar x) (y_i - \\bar y)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The sign of the covariance will match the direction of the relationship between the two variables. The figures below illustrate why. If two variables are positively related, then the scatterplot might look as follows, with most points in the upper-right and lower-left quadrants (when you divide up the plane into four quadrants based on the means of $X$ and $Y$).\n",
    "\n",
    "![](positive_cov.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Each point on this scatterplot contributes to the sum that makes up the covariance. Any point in the upper-right quadrant (where $x$ and $y$ are both greater than their respective means) has a positive contribution, since the product of two positive numbers is positive. A point in the lower-left quadrant (where $x$ and $y$ are both less than their respective means) also has a positive contribution, since the product of two negative numbers is also positive. Therefore, on the whole, the covariance will be positive for two variables with a positive relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also consider two variables with a negative relationship. A scatterplot of two negatively-related variables might look as follows, with most points in the upper-left and lower-right quadrants. Points in both of these quadrants will have a negative contribution towards the covariance, since the product of a positive and a negative number is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](negative_cov.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "What does it mean for the covariance to be _zero_? It does not necessarily mean that there is _no_ relationship at all between the two variables; it just means that the two variables do not move in a consistent direction. For example, the two variables below have _zero_ covariance because the negative contributions from the upper-left and lower-right quadrants perfectly cancel out the positive contributions from the upper-right and lower-left quadrants. However, it would be inaccurate to say that $X$ and $Y$ have _no_ relationship; they have a strong relationship, but it just is not consistently in one direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](zero_cov.png)\n",

    "To calculate the covariance between two quantitative variables, we use the `.cov()` method in `pandas`. This method is attached to one `Series` and takes another `Series` of the same length as input. It returns the covariance between the two `Series`."
